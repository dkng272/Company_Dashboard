# ChatGPT API Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® Common Causes of "No Information Available" Response

### 1. **Model Access Issues**
- **Problem**: You're using `gpt-4o` which might not be available in your API plan
- **Solution**: The updated code now tries multiple models in order: `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4o`

### 2. **Token Limit Too Low**
- **Problem**: `max_tokens=400` was too restrictive for detailed responses
- **Solution**: Increased to `max_tokens=800`

### 3. **Prompt Structure**
- **Problem**: The API might need more explicit instructions than the web interface
- **Solution**: Improved prompt with:
  - Clear role definition
  - Explicit formatting instructions
  - Fallback for missing information
  - System message for context

### 4. **Temperature Setting**
- **Problem**: `temperature=0.7` might cause inconsistent formatting
- **Solution**: Reduced to `temperature=0.3` for more consistent responses

## üîß How to Debug

1. **Enable Debug Mode** in your Streamlit app:
   - Check the "üîß Debug Mode" checkbox
   - Click "Test OpenAI Connection" to verify API access
   - Check which model is being used

2. **Check Raw Response**:
   - The app now shows the raw ChatGPT response
   - Look for any error messages or unexpected formats

3. **Verify API Key**:
   - Make sure your API key is valid and has sufficient credits
   - Check if you have access to GPT-4 models

## üîç Key Improvements Made

1. **Multiple Model Fallback**: Tries GPT-4 ‚Üí GPT-3.5-turbo ‚Üí GPT-4o
2. **Better Error Handling**: Shows which model was used and any errors
3. **Improved Regex**: More robust parsing with case-insensitive matching
4. **Enhanced Prompt**: More explicit instructions and fallback handling
5. **Debug Tools**: Connection testing and raw response display

## üìã Testing Steps

1. **Test API Connection First**:
   ```
   Enable Debug Mode ‚Üí Test OpenAI Connection
   ```

2. **Try a Simple Project Name**:
   - Start with a well-known project like "Landmark 81" or "Vinhomes Central Park"

3. **Check Raw Response**:
   - Look at the "Raw ChatGPT Response" section to see exactly what the API returned

4. **Monitor Model Usage**:
   - The app will show which model was successfully used

## üöÄ Expected Behavior

**Before Fix:**
- Using only `gpt-4o` model
- Limited to 400 tokens
- Basic error handling
- Simple prompt structure

**After Fix:**
- Tries multiple models automatically
- 800 token limit for detailed responses
- Comprehensive error reporting
- Enhanced prompt with clear instructions
- Debug tools for troubleshooting

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **API Credits**: Make sure you have sufficient OpenAI API credits
2. **Rate Limits**: Don't click the button too frequently (respect OpenAI rate limits)
3. **Project Names**: Use full, official project names for better results
4. **Fallback**: The app works perfectly without ChatGPT - it's just an enhancement

Your updated code should now provide much better results and clearer error messages if issues persist!
